1. I found Git Workflow to be the most difficult concept for me for the first week or so.
2. I had no idea what a merge conflict was and that is a very important concept to understand.
3. I asked how to resolve a merge conflict after you discover there is one.
4. What we have learned in git does not confuse me anymroe however, I do wonder what its like to when you have hundreds of people working on different branches at one time.
5. Its always good to have 2 pairs of eyes on something, and overall the experience was positive.
