Prior to the GPS session, I struggled with changing the set URL of the remote repository, as my pair had inadvertently cloned the wrong remote repository.

During this GPS, I learned the difference between using git pull and using git fetch/merge to copy files from the remote repository to the local repository.

I asked when it was appropriate to use fetch/merge as opposed to pull.

I am still unfamiliar with what would happen during a git merge if there are larger merge conflicts made my multiple people.

My first experience of pairing in the GPS was brief, but we were still able to get much done in the time we were working together.
